## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account for backend services

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup
The project uses Supabase for backend services. Ensure your Supabase project is configured with the correct database schema and RLS policies.

### Supabase Project Setup

1.  **Create a new Supabase project:** Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project.
2.  **Get your API keys:** In your Supabase project, go to "Project Settings" > "API". You will need the "Project URL" and the "public" `anon` key.
3.  **Create a `.env` file:** In the root of your project, create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.example` file.
4.  **Add your Supabase credentials to the `.env` file:**
    ```
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
    ```
5.  **Database setup:** Supabase automatically creates the `auth.users` table. When a user signs up, their `full_name` and `club_name` are stored in the `raw_user_meta_data` column.

### 4. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## üóÑ Database Schema

### Tables
- **club_profiles**: Main club information and registration data
- **club_meeting_times**: Scheduled meeting times for clubs
- **club_volunteer_positions**: Volunteer opportunities posted by clubs
- **admin_roles**: Administrative user permissions

### Key Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection
- Automated timestamps with triggers
- Foreign key relationships for data integrity
- Approval workflow for club registrations

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

The platform uses Supabase Auth with the following roles:
- **Public Users**: Can browse approved clubs
- **Club Administrators**: Can manage their club profile and content
- **System Administrators**: Can approve/reject club registrations

## üì± User Interface Components

### Reusable Components
- **Layout**: Main application layout with navigation
- **AuthenticatedNav**: Navigation for logged-in users
- **ProtectedRoute**: Route protection for authenticated areas
- **MeetingTimesSelector**: Interactive meeting time picker
- **VolunteerPositions**: Volunteer opportunity management

### Pages
- **Home**: Landing page with platform overview
- **Clubs**: Public directory of approved clubs
- **Profile**: Club dashboard for administrators
- **Admin**: Administrative approval interface
- **Login/Register**: Authentication pages

## üîß Development Guidelines

### Code Structure
- Components are organized by feature and reusability
- TypeScript interfaces defined in `/src/types/`
- Supabase integration centralized in `/src/integrations/`
- Form validation using Zod schemas

### Best Practices
- All user inputs are validated both client and server-side
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS utilities
- Accessibility considerations throughout the interface
- Error handling with user-friendly toast notifications
