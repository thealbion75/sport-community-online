The registration process has been connected to Supabase. The following files were reviewed and updated:

- `src/pages/Register.tsx`: The registration form component.
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`: The logic for interacting with Supabase auth.
- `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`: The Supabase client initialization.
- `README.md`: Updated with instructions on how to set up the Supabase project.

To get the project running, you will need to create a `.env` file with your Supabase credentials. You can find instructions on how to do this in the `README.md` file.
