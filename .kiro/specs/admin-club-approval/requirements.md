# Admin Club Approval Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing an administrative interface that allows designated administrators to review, approve, or reject club registration applications within the EGSport volunteer sports platform. Currently, club applications require manual database management through Supabase, which is inefficient and not user-friendly for administrators. This feature will provide a proper web-based interface for managing club applications with proper workflow, notifications, and audit trails.
